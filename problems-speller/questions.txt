0.  an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust
1.  returns  resource usage measures 
2.  16
3.  We are determinig how much resources this program has used and those resources also includes time 
    and if we pass time by value , its value will remain constant ,which is not possible . So in order
    to resolve this conflict we pass the value by refernece.
4.  So lets talk about the for loop that checks the spells of the words
    first we open the file and we read it character by character and we read it till we have reached
    the end of file
    so in first if condition we only allow alphabets and apostrophes and update the number of letter on 
    each itteration and then on the other nested else loop we ignore all the numbers by removing all the
    numbers from the letter and then after removing all the letters we start a new word and then finally 
    when all those above conditions are wrong ( nither a alpha or number ) we assume that we have hit the 
    end of the word and then we pass that word to check() function, to check if its right or not and then 
    we print number of misspelling in the word and prepare our program to another word to check if its right
    or not
5.  fscanf uses a format specifier to determine what its reading(like numbers ,char , etc) and if our word
    contains numbers also it will just throw an error to us and our program will crash. So to make sure that 
    even our word contains letters or other symbols ,our program will just skip them all just like MSword do. 
6.  We declared the parameters for check and load as constants beacuse we don't need to change the data that's
    stored in the strings/files to execute the function , so we are just making sure that even if the program 
    tries to change the orignal data it will remain same.
